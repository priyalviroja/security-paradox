## The Story We Tell

Every organization has a story about its risk. Not the formal risk register in the compliance folder—the real story, the one leaders tell themselves when making decisions.

"We're too small to be targeted."

"Our industry isn't interesting to attackers."

"We've never been breached before."

"Our people would never fall for phishing."

These aren't risk assessments. They're narratives. And narratives are powerful—they shape what we see, what we ignore, and what we do.

The problem? **Most of these narratives are fiction.**

## The Narrative Trap

I once worked with a healthcare company that had a beautiful story about their security: "We're a healthcare provider, not a tech company. Attackers go after tech companies with valuable IP. We just have patient records—not interesting enough."

This narrative felt true. It was comforting. It justified their minimal security investment.

Then they were hit by ransomware. The attackers didn't care about their story. They cared that healthcare organizations:
- Can't afford downtime (patients' lives at stake)
- Have insurance that covers ransom payments
- Are often under-invested in security
- Are highly motivated to pay quickly

The attackers had a different narrative—one based on economics, not industry stereotypes. And their narrative was more accurate.

**The company's story about risk was wrong. But they believed it so deeply that they couldn't see the truth until it was too late.**

## Why We Tell Wrong Stories

Humans are narrative creatures. We don't experience reality directly—we experience our stories about reality. And when it comes to risk, our stories are systematically biased:

### 1. The Optimism Bias
"It won't happen to us."

We overestimate our own security and underestimate our risk. Why? Because acknowledging vulnerability is psychologically uncomfortable. It's easier to believe we're special, different, protected.

### 2. The Availability Heuristic
"We've never been breached, so we must be secure."

We judge probability by how easily we can recall examples. If we haven't experienced a breach, we assume it's unlikely—even though the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

### 3. The Narrative Fallacy
"Our security is good because we have [insert impressive-sounding control]."

We create simple, coherent stories to explain complex systems. "We have a firewall" becomes "We're protected." The story is clean, but reality is messy.

### 4. The Sunk Cost Story
"We've invested so much in this security approach, it must be working."

We justify past decisions by telling ourselves they were right—even when evidence suggests otherwise. Changing the narrative means admitting we were wrong.

## The Stories Organizations Tell

Let me share some common narratives I've encountered—and why they're dangerous:

### "We're Compliant, So We're Secure"

The story: "We passed our SOC 2 audit. We're PCI compliant. We have all the certifications. We must be secure."

The reality: Compliance is a floor, not a ceiling. It's a snapshot in time, not continuous security. Attackers don't care about your audit reports.

Why it persists: Compliance is measurable, visible, and easy to explain to boards. Security is ambiguous, invisible, and hard to quantify.

### "Our People Are Our Strongest Defense"

The story: "We've trained our employees. They know how to spot phishing. They're our human firewall."

The reality: Humans make mistakes. Even trained, vigilant people get tired, distracted, or socially engineered. If your security depends on human perfection, it's already broken.

Why it persists: It's cheaper to blame people than to fix systems. And it feels empowering—"we're all in this together!"

### "We're Too Small to Be Targeted"

The story: "Attackers go after big companies with valuable data. We're not worth their time."

The reality: Most attacks are automated and opportunistic. Attackers don't care about your size—they care about your vulnerability. Small companies are often easier targets because they invest less in security.

Why it persists: It's comforting. It absolves leadership of responsibility. "It's not our fault we're not investing in security—we're just not a target."

### "We Have the Best Tools"

The story: "We use [expensive security vendor]. We have EDR, SIEM, SOAR, XDR. We're protected."

The reality: Tools don't equal security. Misconfigured tools, alert fatigue, lack of skilled analysts, poor processes—these undermine even the best technology.

Why it persists: Tools are tangible. You can point to them in a budget meeting. Culture and process are intangible and harder to sell.

## Rewriting the Narrative

So how do you escape the narrative trap? How do you tell yourself—and your organization—a more accurate story about risk?

### 1. Interrogate Your Assumptions

Ask: "What story are we telling ourselves about our risk? What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it?"

Example:
- Story: "We've never been breached, so our security is good."
- Counter-evidence: "We also don't have detection capabilities, so we wouldn't know if we'd been breached."

### 2. Seek Disconfirming Evidence

Actively look for information that challenges your narrative. Run tabletop exercises. Conduct red team assessments. Talk to people who've been breached.

The goal is not to be pessimistic—it's to be realistic.

### 3. Separate Activity from Outcomes

Ask: "What outcome are we trying to achieve? Is our current approach actually achieving it?"

Example:
- Activity: "We conduct quarterly security training."
- Outcome: "Are people actually changing their behavior? Are we seeing fewer security incidents?"

If the activity doesn't drive the outcome, the narrative is broken.

### 4. Embrace Probabilistic Thinking

Replace certainty with probability:
- Not: "We won't be breached."
- But: "We have a X% chance of being breached in the next year. Here's how we're reducing that probability and preparing for the possibility."

This is uncomfortable. Leaders want certainty. But certainty is a lie.

### 5. Make Risk Concrete

Abstract risk is easy to dismiss. Concrete risk is harder to ignore.

Instead of: "We face cyber risk."
Try: "If we're breached, we could lose $10M in revenue, face regulatory fines of $5M, and damage customer trust for years. Here's a scenario of how it could happen."

Stories with characters, stakes, and consequences are more powerful than statistics.

## The Leader's Role

As a security leader, your job is not just to manage risk—it's to **manage the narrative about risk**.

This means:

**1. Telling Better Stories**

Don't just present data. Tell stories that help people understand:
- What could happen (scenario)
- Why it matters (impact)
- What we can do about it (action)

**2. Challenging Comfortable Narratives**

When you hear "We're too small to be targeted" or "We've never been breached," push back gently:
- "That's a common belief. Let me share some data that challenges it..."
- "I used to think that too. Then I learned..."

**3. Creating Space for Uncomfortable Truths**

Build a culture where people can say:
- "I don't know if we're secure."
- "I'm worried about this risk."
- "I think we're telling ourselves a comforting story that isn't true."

**4. Modeling Probabilistic Thinking**

Show leadership how to think in probabilities, not certainties:
- "There's a 30% chance of X happening in the next year."
- "If we invest in Y, we can reduce that to 10%."
- "We can't eliminate the risk, but we can manage it."

## The Meta-Narrative

Here's the deepest insight: **the story you tell about risk becomes your reality**.

If you tell yourself "We're secure," you stop looking for vulnerabilities.

If you tell yourself "We're too small to matter," you stop investing in protection.

If you tell yourself "It won't happen to us," you stop preparing for when it does.

The narrative shapes behavior. Behavior shapes outcomes. Outcomes reinforce the narrative.

This is why getting the story right is so critical. It's not just about accuracy—it's about creating a narrative that drives the right behaviors:

- A narrative of **vigilance** (not paranoia)
- A narrative of **resilience** (not invulnerability)
- A narrative of **continuous improvement** (not perfection)
- A narrative of **shared responsibility** (not blame)

## The Practice

So here's my challenge to you:

**What story are you telling yourself about your organization's risk?**

Write it down. Actually write it. Then ask:
- Is this story based on evidence or assumption?
- What would I need to believe for this story to be false?
- What am I not seeing because this story is so comfortable?
- What behavior is this story driving?
- Is that the behavior I want?

Then rewrite the story. Make it more accurate, more nuanced, more useful.

Because in the end, **risk is not just what might happen—it's the story we tell ourselves about what might happen**.

And the quality of that story determines the quality of our decisions.
