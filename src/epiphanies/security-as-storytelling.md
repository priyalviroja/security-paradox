<span class="epiphany-label">The Story</span>

A CISO presented to the board: "We need $2M for a SIEM upgrade. Our current system has 47% coverage and lacks ML-based anomaly detection."

The board looked confused. The CFO asked: "What does that mean for the business?"

Silence.

Another CISO, different company, different approach: "Last quarter, a competitor lost $50M and their CEO in a breach that started with a phishing email. Our current email security would not have caught it. For the cost of 0.1% of our revenue, we can ensure that story doesn't become ours."

The board approved it in five minutes.

Security is not a technical problem. It's a communication problem. And communication is storytelling.

<span class="epiphany-label">The Reflection</span>

Technical leaders often believe that data speaks for itself. It doesn't.

Humans don't make decisions based on statistics—we make decisions based on stories. We remember narratives, not numbers. We act on emotion, not analysis.

The best security leaders are storytellers. They translate technical risk into business impact. They make the abstract concrete. They turn "CVE-2024-1234 with a CVSS score of 9.8" into "This is the vulnerability that took down Colonial Pipeline."

But storytelling isn't manipulation—it's translation. It's making the invisible visible. It's helping non-technical stakeholders understand what's at stake.

Every security decision is a story:
- A story about what could happen
- A story about what we value
- A story about who we want to be

The question is: are you telling that story well?
