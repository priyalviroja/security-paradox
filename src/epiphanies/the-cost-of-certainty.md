A CEO asked their CISO: "Can you guarantee we won't be breached?"

The CISO, wanting to keep their job, said: "Yes, with our new security program, we'll be fully protected."

The CEO smiled, reassured.

Two years later, they were breached. The CEO felt betrayed. The CISO was fired.

A different CEO asked their CISO the same question.

This CISO said: "No. I can reduce the likelihood, minimize the impact, and ensure we recover quickly. But certainty is impossible—and anyone who promises it is lying."

The CEO frowned, uncomfortable. But they trusted this CISO more.

When the breach came—and it did—the CEO wasn't surprised. They were prepared.

<span class="epiphany-label">The Reflection</span>

Leaders crave certainty. Boards want guarantees. Executives want promises.

But in security, certainty is a lie.

The world is too complex, attackers too creative, systems too interconnected. Every guarantee is a future failure waiting to happen.

The cost of certainty is twofold:

1. **False confidence**: When leaders believe they're safe, they stop investing in resilience
2. **Broken trust**: When the inevitable happens, the betrayal is worse than the breach

The alternative isn't pessimism—it's probabilistic thinking:
- "We can reduce the likelihood from X% to Y%"
- "We can detect breaches in hours instead of months"
- "We can limit the blast radius to this boundary"

This is uncomfortable. It requires leaders to sit with uncertainty, to accept risk, to plan for failure.

But it's honest. And honesty builds trust.

The best security leaders don't promise certainty. They promise resilience.

"Certainty is a lie. Promise resilience, not invulnerability. The goal is not to prevent all failures—it's to survive them."
