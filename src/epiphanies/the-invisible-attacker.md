<span class="epiphany-label">The Story</span>

During a security review, I asked the team: "Who's your biggest threat?"

They listed nation-states, organized crime, hacktivists. All external.

Then I asked: "Who approved the decision to store customer data in that third-party analytics tool without encryption?"

Silence.

"Who decided that the intern could have admin access to production?"

More silence.

"Who chose to skip the security review because the launch date couldn't move?"

The real attacker wasn't outside the walls. It was embedded in the org chart—in misaligned incentives, in rushed decisions, in the gap between policy and practice.

The most dangerous vulnerabilities aren't in the code. They're in the culture.

<span class="epiphany-label">The Reflection</span>

We spend millions on firewalls and intrusion detection, but the biggest security holes are organizational:

- The VP who pressures teams to ship without security review
- The procurement process that chooses the cheapest vendor, not the most secure
- The culture that rewards speed over safety
- The incentive structure that punishes people for reporting problems

These aren't malicious actors. They're well-intentioned people operating within broken systems.

Security leaders who only think about external threats are fighting yesterday's war. The modern security challenge is organizational design: aligning incentives, building culture, creating systems where secure choices are easy choices.

You can't firewall your way out of a culture problem.

<div class="principle-takeaway">
"The org chart is your attack surface. Security is not just technical—it's cultural, organizational, and human. Design systems where the secure path is the path of least resistance."
