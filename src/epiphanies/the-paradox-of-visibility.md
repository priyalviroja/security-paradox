<span class="epiphany-label">The Story</span>

A security team deployed a new monitoring system. Suddenly, they could see everything—every login, every API call, every file access. The dashboard lit up with thousands of alerts.

"We're under attack!" someone shouted.

They weren't. They were just seeing, for the first time, what normal looked like.

Within a week, alert fatigue set in. Engineers started ignoring notifications. The security team spent all their time investigating false positives. When a real breach happened three months later, the alert was buried in noise.

More visibility didn't make them more secure. It made them blind in a different way.

<span class="epiphany-label">The Reflection</span>

There's a paradox at the heart of security: the more you can see, the less you can perceive.

Visibility without context is noise. Data without meaning is chaos. Alerts without prioritization are paralysis.

The goal isn't to see everything—it's to see the *right* things. To distinguish signal from noise. To know what matters.

This requires:
- **Filtering**: Not all data is equally important
- **Context**: Understanding what's normal before you can spot what's abnormal
- **Prioritization**: Focusing on high-signal, high-impact events
- **Automation**: Letting machines handle the noise so humans can focus on the signal

The best security teams don't have the most visibility. They have the most *clarity*.

They ask: "What do we need to see to make better decisions?" Not: "What can we see?"
